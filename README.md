## Requirements

You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
Deposits, withdrawal. Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## User Stories

 Using the required specifications, I devised a set of user stories to break down the tasks into smaller steps.

    As a client
    So that I have my money in one place
    I would like to open a bank account.

    As a client
    So I can save my money
    I would like to make deposits into my account.

    As a client
    So I can spend my money
    I would like to make witrhdrawals from my account.

    As a client
    So I can keep track of my spending 
    I would like to print my bank statement and view my transactions.

## Approach
    
The key concepts that I attempted to adhere to were:

* Object-oriented design
* Test-driven development
* Concise methods
* Seperation of concerns
